This is a project I put together in conjuction with reading Charles Petzold's *CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software*.  It builds up a CPU and RAM from components that are ultimately a collection of relays.

I consider this book a must read for any computer scientist, software engineer, or programmer.
